I know it has been a long time without a release, but Watir 6.17 is now available on RubyGems!
Mostly just a maintenance update, but Ruby 2.5 or greater now required and all of the warnings and
noise from recent Selenium versions should be silenced. Mostly I'm pleased that in addition to 
code from the 3 main contributors, we received code submissions from four additional authors: 
Lakshya Kapoor, Matthew Mazaika, Olle Jonsson & Joe Schulte. Thank you for your work!

***To install:***

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install watir
{% endhighlight %}

***or in your Gemfile:*** 

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "watir", "~> 6.17"
{% endhighlight %}

### Convenience Methods
1. `Element#right_click` now accepts modifiers for key presses just like `Element#click`
2. `FileField#upload` exists was added (same functionality as `FileField#set`)
3. `Logger#selenium=` allows setting selenium log level directly
4. Browser now accepts a `:service` parameter with a Selenium Service instance value

### Deprecations and Removals
1. `Element#scroll_into_view` is deprecated in favor of the new `Element#scroll` functionality
2. Selenium noise from latest version is quieted

### Bug Fixes
1. Locator code now respects case sensitivity and insensitivity based on w3c html specification
2. Each browser instance gets its own timer to allow threading
3. There was a location issue when an iframe was nested under another element
4. Locating with Regular Expressions used to only match direct child text nodes, now it matches any descendent
