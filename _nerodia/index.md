The goal of this project is to be as close to Watir as possible. 
In terms of functionality, it is equivalent; however, 
there are [some syntax differences](https://nerodia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/watir.html)
due to the nature of Python.
You can check out the [Watir Guides](../guides)

[comment]: <> (TODO: Add guide + link to syntax differences)
